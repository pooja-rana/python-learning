 1) What is Destructor in Python?

 Ans:- A destructor is called when an object is deleted or destroyed. Destructor is used to perform the clean-up
       activity before destroying the object, such as closing database connections or filehandle.

       Python has a garbage collector that handles memory management automatically.
       For example, it cleans up the memory when an object goes out of scope.

       But itâ€™s not just memory that has to be freed when an object is destroyed.
       We must release or close the other resources object were using, such as open files,
       database connections, cleaning up the buffer or cache. To perform all those cleanup tasks
       we use destructor in Python.

       destructor is not called manually but completely automatic. destructor gets called in the
       following two cases

        1) When an object goes out of scope or
        2) The reference counter of the object reaches 0.

            def __del__(self):
                # body of a destructor
