  1)What is Polymorphism in Python?
   Ans:- Polymorphism in Python is the ability of an object to take many forms. In simple words,
         polymorphism allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.
         For example, Jessa acts as an employee when she is at the office. However, when she is at home,
         she acts like a wife. Also, she represents herself differently in different places.
         Therefore, the same person takes different forms as per the situation.
         In polymorphism, a method can process objects differently depending on the class type or data type.
