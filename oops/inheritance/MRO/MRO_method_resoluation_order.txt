    Q) what is MRO in python?
    Ans:-  Method Resolution Order(MRO) is the order by which Python looks for a method or attribute. First,
           the method or attribute is searched within a class, and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting.

           This order is also called the Linearization of a class, and a set of rules is called MRO (Method Resolution Order).
           The MRO plays an essential role in multiple inheritances as a single method may found in multiple parent classes.

           We can get the MRO of a class. For this purpose, we can use either the mro attribute or the mro() method.
