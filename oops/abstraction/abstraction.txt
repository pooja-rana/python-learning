    1) what is abstraction?
    Ans :- Abstraction is one of the important topics of object-oriented programming (OOP) which is used to handle complexity by
           hiding unnecessary information and showing only essential information to the user. Abstraction becomes very useful when
           we want to implement or handle complex logic without knowing the hidden complexity.

      --> abstraction in python

           Letâ€™s understand how we can use the inbuild python class Abstract Base Class (ABC) to achieve data abstraction in python.
           We can say a class is an abstract class when a class contains an abstract method. We can use @abstractmethod keyword to define
           an abstract method in python.

      --> What are Concrete Methods in Abstract Base Class(ABC)?
          If a class contains only concrete methods ( normal methods) we can say it is a concrete class. On the other hand, an abstract class
          contains both normal and abstract methods. The concrete class is mainly used to provide an implementation of the abstract methods of
          the abstract superclass.

      --> Abstract Properties of an Abstract Class:-
          An abstract base class of python also provides the functionality of abstract properties along with abstractmethod. We can use the @abstractproperty
          decorator of the abc module to achieve abstract properties. Abstract properties are generally used to achieve getters and setters functionality.
